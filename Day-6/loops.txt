Loops: Loops are used to iterate certain statemnets again and again untill a condition fails
There are two kind of loops 
i. Entry controll loops
ii.Exit controll loops

i. Entry control Loops: These loops are used  to check the condtion at the starting of the loop and run the statements if the condition
  is true once the statement are over it again checks the condition and repeats the process
    eg:while and for

while:while is an  entry control loops which used condition, updation and initialization in three defferent statement
 syntax : 
          initialization;
          while(condition){
            //statement;
            updation;
          }
  eg:print numbers 1 to 10 using while 
    let i = 1;
while(i<=10){
    console.log(i);
    i++
}        
 
 for: is also an entry controll loop which is used to iterate certain statement by using initialization , condition  and updation in same line
 syntax : 
         for(initialization;condition;updation){
            //statement;
         }
eg: altarnate letters of given strings (Inpu:prasad,output:p,a,a)

let name = "Junaid";
for(let j =0;j<=name.length-1;j+=2){
    console.log(name.charAt([j]));
}
  
   
   let arr = [1,2,3,4]
for(let k =0;k<=arr.length-1;k++){
    console.log(arr[k]);
}
 


 This is called stadard -for
 But  in javascript there are other variation of for such as 
 for...of, for..in 
 for..of is used to print the value of an array it will assing the value to the varible you assing befor 'of' and it will print all the arraly elemets
 
  syntax: for(let i of arrayName){
     //statements
  }
  i will be automatically array element

  eg .let arr [5,4,3,2,1]
  for(let i of arr){
    console.log(i);
  }

  for..in is used t iterate array indexes / addresses
