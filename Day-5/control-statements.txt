The decision making statement these are also called controll statements which are used to controll the flow of code
based on a condition or decision .Most used decision making statement are  
if
switch 

if if is use as a control statement where  if leads to a block of code of if the  condition is true 
 there are multiple variation for if such as 
  i. simple if:
     if(condition){
        //statement
     }
     it deals with if on only when condition is  true and it execute the block of statement
 ii. if-else:
     if(condition){
        //statement
     }
     else{
        //statement
     }
     if the condition is true then it will lead and execute the if block or it will lead to the else block

iii.if else if:

     if(condition){
     //statement
     }
    else if(condition){
    //statement
    }
    else{
     //statement
    }
  if condition is true it leads to the if block , if it is false it will check the else if block and if it is false it will execute the else block
  
  iv. nested if: we can even keep an if statement inside another if called "nested if"

   if(condition){
    //statement

      if(condition){

     //statement
      }
   }




  switch: switch  works with multiple conditions using cases. It is an altarnative aproach on if else -if but each case should be terminated
  by using keyword break else fall into the next case and always need a case for "defualt" entry

    switch(statement){
    case value1://statement break;
      case value2://statement break;
        case value3://statement break;
          case value4://statement break;
            defualt://statement

    }
