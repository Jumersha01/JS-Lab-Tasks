Datatypes in Javascript:
Javascript is the dynamic programming language it means in Javascript, there is no fixed Datatype to a variable.
The datatype of a variable id ecided by the value is is holding.

There are two type of datatype
1. premitive datatype
2.non-premitive datatype

1. premitive datatype : these datatype hold the value and compare the value.these datatype are immutable..
---There are 5 basic premitive datatype such as number, string ,undefined ,bolean, null

2.non-premitive datatype:these datatype hold the value and compares the address or the reference. these datatypes are mutable
the basic non-premitive datatype are function, arrays, objects
  
Can we change one datatype into another datatype
YES, Ther process of changing one dataype into to another datatype id called typecasting .there are two types of typecasting
       1.Implicit typecasting
       2.Explicit typecasting

1. Emplicit typecasting: it is the default or automatic conversion of datatype based on operaion
eg. 10 +"5"===> "10"+"5" ==>"105"

5+'4     ==> "54"
5*'4'    ==> 20

2.Explicit typecasting: its the forced way of converting one datatype to another 
e.g

5+ +'4'  ==>9
5+number('4') 5+4 = > 9
 
 number:any numerical value is a number 
 Every number can have some default methods such as toString , toPrecision, etc..
 numbers also have math methods such as sqrt, cbrt, pow, ceil, floor ,round;
