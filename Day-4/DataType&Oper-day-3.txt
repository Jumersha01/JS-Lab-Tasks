Bolean: it is used fot store tru/ false .if conveted to nummber true will be 1 and false will be 0

undefined: undefined is the primitive datatype or value that represents uninitialized or non exitstent element
let y;
console.log(y)//undefined 
undefined expect future occupance of value

null: null is also the primitive value that indicate the variable has no value or no objectf

                                          Operators
=================================================================================================================================

Operator are used to perfoms operation there are different types of operators such as

i.Arithmetic Operator:(+,-,/(direct division),%,*,**(Power))

ii.Relational Operator:These operator are used for comparison
      eg(>,<,>=,<=,==(it will compare only value not dataype),===(strict equals compares value and the datatype)
      != retrurn the negation of ==
     !==--return the nagation of === )

iii.Logical Operators :These operators are used to for combing the statment logically
      (&&Logical AND) --logical and return true if both are true
      (|| Logical OR)---logical Or it will return true if any one is true
      (!Lgical NOT)---- it will return true when actual statment is false

 iv.Increametn and Decreament:These are unary operator which is used to increament value by 1 and decreament decrease the value by 1     
   pre-increamet: fist updated the value and return it
   post-increament :first return the value and updates it

   similar to decreament also
   b = 10; ++b --->11
   b = 10; b++ -->10 b,value become 11 later

   v.Ternary Operator or conditional Operator: it is shorthand operator used to check the condition true or false and make  a decision
   on that value 
   let a =10;
   let c = (a>5)?20:30;

   vi.nullish coalescing:it will check two vales and return first value if it is not undefined or null,else it return  second value
     let a  = 10;
     let b = 20;
     let c = a??b;
